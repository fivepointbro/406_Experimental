This top section of the file is ONLY used to explain how it works
None of this will actually appear on your page - don't worry!
Everything after "page content below" is stuff that appears once on the page
Things like the title of the page, or any large bodies of text
Everything after "repeated items below" means multiple items, like a list of "people"
You can also have sub-lists, like a list of cars that each person owns
This is essentially my own coding language designed for people who can't code
Follow the rules and let the algorhithm do the rest!
----------------------

Rules: Please read!
Only one statement per line
You can use a single line break..

Or two line breaks as above, so there's a gap between lines (easier to read)
Any line that doesn't start with a label (for example "Rules:")...
Will be assumed to be a part of the most recent label item
In this case all these lines after "Rules" would be part of "Rules"
To make a new repeatable object, just make three line breaks
You can use more than three if you'd like, but three is the minimum


Rules: This would be considered a new object, in this case a new "set" of rules
And this line would be considered part of that set of rules. Makes sense, right?

Arrows represent a heirarchy, such as a list. Use the right "=>" to go down
And use "tab" (or hit the space bar 4+ times) to indent the sub-list items 
Then put a comma at the very end of each object, on the last item only
For example...

List: =>
    name: Bob
    hat: blue,

    name: Rob
    hat: red,

That would create a list called "List" with two objects (people) inside of it
And each object would have two properties, in this case a name and a hat color

That's all there is to it. Good luck and have fun! Try not to break it
