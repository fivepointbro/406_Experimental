title: Instructor Information


subtitle: Welcome to 406 Squadron


text: Congratulations on being selected to be an instructor. It is one of the most important jobs you will have in the CAF, and possibly the most rewarding. Being an instructor is more than simply tossing material out to the students. The resources/links below are provided for you to reference as you develop your instructional skills/abilities and go about your daily job as a quality instructor. The foundation to this is your Instructional Techniques - Basic - National Qualification (NQual) AHCH/Flight Instructor - NQual AIMB. The Canadian Forces Training Development Centre (CFTDC) has an Instructor Development Program which includes a number of courses available in Borden and/or distributed across the CAF to further develop your skills/abilities. Reach out to your Sqn Training Development Officer to discuss these opportunities. Also, take the time to review the Learning Aid articles under the Student Information tab as these can also support you as an instructor if you find one of your students facing a unique challenge which may be having an impact on their learning.
